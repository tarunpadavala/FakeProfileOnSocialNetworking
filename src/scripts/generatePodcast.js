    "Thank you, Dr. James. I'm Dr. Michael, and I'm excited to share some insights from recent research in eye health.",
    "That's right. The cornea helps focus light, while the lens behind it fine-tunes the focus. The retina then converts light into signals our brain can understand.",
    "Absolutely. Early detection is key. Many eye conditions show no early symptoms, which is why regular screening is so important."
